# Lifecycle-Ruby

Welcome to Lifecycle. If you are unfamiliar with who we are and what we do, check us out at [lifecycle.io](https://lifecycle.io).
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lifecycle_api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lifecycle_api

## Usage
To use, simply create an instance of the client and identify and track away!

```ruby
require 'lifecycle_api'

lifecycle = Lifecycle::Client.new 'YOUR_LIFECYCLE_API_KEY'
```

TO IDENTIFY:
```ruby
lifecycle.identify params #(see example of params)
```

TO TRACK:
```ruby
lifecycle.track 'event_id', 'unique_id'
```


```ruby
#Example of params variable to use with identify call
params = {:unique_id => "1234",
          :first_name => "Nathan",
          :last_name => "Mooney",
          :email_address => "someone@lifecycle.io",
          :phone_number => "12345678913"
}
```
Use this gem to interact with your Lifecycle account. Easily identify users and track users with minimal code. If you are looking for packages in a language other than ruby, check out the TeamLifecycle organization for your desired language. It is our hope that by providing this gem, integration and usage of Lifecycle will be quick and easy.
